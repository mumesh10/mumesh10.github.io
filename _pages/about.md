          To study the pitch, yaw and roll of the polishing ball from a video of it using deep learning methods. Did literature review on various machine learning and deep learning methods for temporal super resolution of a video. Using shape recovery from fast moving objects(deep learning method) to study the motion of the ball using Kaolin library
